# Cigarette Machinery Maker & Packer
PT. Djitoe Mesindo was established in 1969, initially producing handmade clove cigarettes. In 1980, the company finally purchased machines to produce filter cigarettes. In 1983, the company expanded its business by acquiring cigarette-making machines and packaging machines for the domestic Indonesian market.

In 1993, PT. Djitoe Mesindo introduced its machine reconditioning business to the international market. In 1998, the machine reconditioning business was expanded to Batam Island to boost exports. Currently, PT. Djitoe Mesindo is the largest supplier of cigarette-making machines and packaging machines in the Asian region, earning the title “Top Quality Cigarette Machine,” which remains a source of pride for the employees and staff of PT. Djitoe Mesindo.

PT. Djitoe Mesindo was established in Batam on August 17, 1998. The geographical location of Djitoe Cigarette Company is specifically at Tanjung Uncang Number 51, with a factory area of about 40,000 m². Given its location on the main road, which is a route for buses and trucks, the company benefits significantly. The factory's position on the main road greatly supports the smooth transportation of facilities owned by PT. Djitoe Mesindo, including vehicles used to transport materials purchased from suppliers and to deliver its products to designated marketing areas such as representative offices or agents. Additionally, vehicles used for employee transportation contribute significantly to the smooth operation of the company's activities.

## Since 2024
In 2024, due to the high demand from customers for operating manuals for these machines, the team took the initiative to create these manuals. Naturally, these manuals also serve as a crucial requirement for being considered "prepared" in the production machinery industry, ensuring that all users can operate the machines efficiently and safely.

This initiative was spearheaded by Mas Ical. In its first phase, the team consisted of 3 members. During the second phase, the team expanded to 6 members, and eventually, it grew to a total of 7 members.
